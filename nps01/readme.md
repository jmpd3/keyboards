The nps01 is a handwired programmable numpad featuring a rotary encoder for the volume(this can be changed inside of vial), and a YD-RP2040 board as its central processing unit. Encased in a [SiCK-PAD](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3682168) case modified to fit the controller, this keyboard offers 8 programmable layers.
