The MP4B4 is a 4 by 4 key handwired macropad featuring a YD-RP2040 board as its central processing unit. Encased in a modified Void 16 case tailored to accommodate the controller, as well as an adapter made to fit a rotary encoder in a mx socket, this keyboard offers 8 programmable layers. The default 2 layers operate as a numpad, and the built-in RGB LED serves as a layer indicator.
